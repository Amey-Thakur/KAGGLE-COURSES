<!-- OVERVIEW -->
<a name="overview"></a>
## Overview

**Kaggle** features a comprehensive archive of completed **Kaggle Courses** in Data Science, Machine Learning, and Data Manipulation. Curated by [**Amey Thakur**](https://github.com/Amey-Thakur) and [**Mega Satish**](https://github.com/msatmod), this project documents a disciplined progression through 7 official Kaggle courses. We successfully navigated the course material, from data cleaning fundamentals to machine learning explainability, earning recognized certifications as a testament to this scholarly effort.

The project demonstrates a disciplined approach to upskilling in Data Science, leveraging the **Python Ecosystem** (Pandas, Numpy, Scikit-Learn, XGBoost) to solve real-world analytical problems.

### Learning Objectives
The curriculum is governed by strict **computational data science principles**:
*   **Data Wrangling**: Mastering `pandas` for efficient data manipulation, cleaning, and transformation.
*   **Visual Analytics**: Utilizing `matplotlib` and `seaborn` for exploratory data analysis and publication-quality visualizations.
*   **Machine Learning**: Implementing robust models from decision trees to gradient boosting and understanding model explainability.

> [!TIP]
> **Kaggle Course Completion**
